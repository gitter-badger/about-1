This is my first post of the new blog.

I moved my old blog to Jekyll and the results are pretty amazing.
These are the steps you need to follow to create a blog like this.
You must have Node.js and Ruby installed before using Jekyll.

{% highlight bash %}
gem install jekyll
jekyll new my-new-blog
cd my-new-blog
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Just go to `http://127.0.0.1:4000` to see your new blog.
